This section takes you through the process of running and building a quickstart Go plugin, included within Tyk's [getting started](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/custom-go-plugin) repository. Go plugins are the recommended plugin type and suitable for most use cases.

## Expected outcome

At the end of this process you should have a Tyk Gateway or Tyk Self-Managed environment running locally, with a simple Go plugin executing on each API request. For each reponse to an API request the example plugin will inject a *Foo* header, with a value of *Bar*.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Tyk license](https://tyk.io/sign-up/#self) (if using Self-Managed Tyk, which will make the process easier via UI)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make)
- OSX (Intel) -> Not a prerequisite, though these steps are tested on OSX Intel/ARM

## Before you begin

Please clone the [getting started](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/custom-go-plugin) respository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TykTechnologies/custom-go-plugin
cd custom-go-plugin
```
