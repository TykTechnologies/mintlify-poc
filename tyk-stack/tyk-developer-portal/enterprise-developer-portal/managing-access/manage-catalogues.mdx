## Introduction

Catalogs are a way for you to tailor the audience for API products and Plans. You can, for example create a Partner Catalog, with a specific API product tailored to them and a preferential plan not available in your public portal.

In this section, you will learn about how catalogs work and how to create a new catalog to expose your API products and plans.

**Prerequisites**

- Connect to a provider [Tyk Self-Managed](/portal/overview/getting-started#connect-to-a-provider)
- Create [policies with enforced access rights](/portal/overview/getting-started#create-api-products-and-plans) (API Product in the Portal)
- Create one or more [policies with enforced rate limit and quotas](/portal/overview/getting-started#create-api-products-and-plans) (Plan in the Portal)

## Create a New Catalog

4. Set the access required for the catalog e.g. Public, Private or Custom

  - Public: External developers can access the catalog
  - Private: The catalog is only visible to developers that are logged in
  - Custom: Only selected teams can access this catalog

5.  [If creating a custom catalog] Under Audience, select one or multiple teams that you want to have access to this catalog.



    <Note>
    For this audience to apply, the visibility needs to be set to custom.
