<Note>
Installing Tyk on Kubernetes requires a multi-node Tyk license. If you are evaluating Tyk on Kubernetes, [contact us](https://tyk.io/about/contact/) to obtain an temporary license.
</Note>



<Warning>
This deployment is NOT designed for production use or performance testing. The Tyk Pro Docker Demo is our full, [Self-Managed](/content/tyk-self-managed/install.md) solution, which includes our Gateway, Dashboard and analytics processing pipeline. 

This demo will run Tyk Self-Managed on your machine, which contains 5 containers: Tyk Gateway, Tyk Dashboard, Tyk Pump, Redis and either MongoDB or one of our supported [SQL databases](/content/tyk-dashboard/database-options.md).

This demo is great for proof of concept and demo purposes, but if you want to test performance, you need to move each component to a separate machine.
</Warning>



<Note>
You use this at your own risk. Tyk is not supported on the Windows platform. However you can test it as a proof of concept using our Pro Demo Docker installation.
</Note>
