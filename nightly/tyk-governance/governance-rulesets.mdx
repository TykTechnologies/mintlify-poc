## Availability

- Version: Available since v0.2

## Overview

Governance Rulesets enable you to define, manage, and enforce API standards across your organization through customizable rules. These rulesets act as executable policies that define your organization's API governance requirements, helping you establish consistent standards for security, design, and documentation.

### Key Benefits

- **Standardize API Development**: Define consistent patterns and practices for all APIs
- **Centralize Governance Policies**: Maintain standards in a single location accessible to all teams
- **Customize to Your Needs**: Create organization-specific rules or use pre-built templates
- **Evolve Standards Gradually**: Adjust rule severity and scope as your governance program matures
- **Share Knowledge**: Embed best practices and remediation guidance directly in rules

### Dependencies

- Requires Tyk Governance v0.2 or higher

## Quick Start

In this tutorial, we'll create a simple governance ruleset that can be used to validate APIs.

### Prerequisites

- Access to Tyk Governance Hub

### Step-by-Step

1. **Access the Rulesets Section**

    Navigate to the Rulesets section in your Tyk Governance dashboard.

2. **Create a New Ruleset**

    Click the "Create new ruleset" button to create a new ruleset.

4. **Customize Your Ruleset**

    Review the pre-configured rules. You can enable/disable specific rules or adjust their severity levels.

    <img src="/img/governance/ruleset-template-2.png" alt="" />

    Then, provide a name and description for your ruleset.

    <img src="/img/governance/ruleset-template-3.png" alt="" />

5. **Save Your Ruleset**

    Click **Finish** to create your new ruleset.

6. **View Your Ruleset**

    Your new ruleset will appear in the rulesets list. Click on it to view details and manage individual rules.

### Validation

- Successful ruleset creation will be confirmed with a success message
- The ruleset will appear in your rulesets list
- You can now use this ruleset to [evaluate APIs](/nightly/tyk-governance/api-evaluation)

## How It Works

Governance Rulesets use a powerful rule engine based on the Spectral format to define standards for API specifications. Each rule consists of a selector that identifies parts of the API specification to evaluate, a function that performs the evaluation, and metadata that provides context and remediation guidance.

### Rule Structure

A typical rule in a ruleset includes:

- **Given**: A JSONPath expression that selects parts of the API specification
- **Then**: Functions to apply to the selected parts
- **Severity**: The importance level (error, warn, info, hint)
- **Message**: A description of what the rule checks
- **HowToFix**: Guidance on resolving any violations

When you create a ruleset, you're defining a collection of these rules that work together to enforce your governance standards.

### Example Rulesets

#### Security Standards Ruleset

Create rulesets that define security requirements for APIs, such as authentication requirements, secure endpoints, and protection against common vulnerabilities.

```yaml
security-auth-required:
  description: APIs must require authentication
  severity: error
  given: $.paths.*.*
  then:
    field: security
    function: truthy
  howToFix: "Add a security requirement to this operation"
```

#### API Design Standards Ruleset

Define rules that enforce naming conventions, URL patterns, and response structures to maintain consistency across your API portfolio.

```yaml
path-case-convention:
  description: Path segments must use kebab-case
  severity: warn
  given: $.paths
  then:
    field: "@key"
    function: pattern
    functionOptions:
      match: "^\/([a-z0-9-]+|{[a-zA-Z0-9_]+})(\/{[a-zA-Z0-9_]+}|\/[a-z0-9-]+)*$"
  howToFix: "Rename path segments to use kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)"
```

#### Documentation Standards Ruleset

Create rules that check for complete and accurate documentation, including descriptions, examples, and response schemas.

```yaml
operation-description:
  description: All operations must have descriptions
  severity: warn
  given: $.paths.*.*
  then:
    field: description
    function: truthy
  howToFix: "Add a meaningful description to this operation"
```

## Manage Rulesets

### Creating Rulesets

Rulesets define governance standards and ensure API compliance with security, performance, and reliability requirements. You can create rulesets through the Governance UI or programmatically via the API.

#### Using the UI

The Governance UI provides a user-friendly interface for creating rulesets:

1. Navigate to the Rulesets section
2. Click **Create new ruleset**
3. Choose how to create your ruleset (import from file, paste definition, or start from template)
4. Provide basic information (name, description)
5. Save your ruleset

#### Using the API

You can also create rulesets programmatically using the API.

**Creating a Ruleset with JSON Payload**

```sh
curl -X POST https://your-governance-instance.tyk.io/api/rulesets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "metadata": {
      "name": "Security Standards",
      "description": "Security rules for all APIs",
      "active": true
    },
    "ruleset": {
      "rules": {
        "security-auth-required": {
          "description": "APIs must require authentication",
          "severity": "error",
          "given": "$.paths.*.*",
          "then": {
            "field": "security",
            "function": "truthy"
          },
          "howToFix": "Add a security requirement to this operation"
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

**Creating Rulesets from Files**

For more complex rulesets or when you maintain your rulesets as files in your development environment, you can create rulesets directly from files using a multipart form request.

To create a ruleset from a file, you need to send a multipart form request with two key components:

1. `metadata`: JSON object containing ruleset metadata (name, description, etc.)
2. `ruleset`: The ruleset definition file content (in YAML or JSON format)

Here's how to create a ruleset from a YAML file using curl:

```sh
curl -X POST https://your-governance-instance.tyk.io/api/rulesets \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -F "metadata={\"name\":\"API Security Ruleset\",\"description\":\"Enforces API security best practices\",\"active\":true}" \
  -F "ruleset=@/path/to/your/ruleset.yaml"
```

### Managing Rulesets

Once created, rulesets can be managed through the UI or API:

#### Viewing Rulesets

- Navigate to the Rulesets section to see all rulesets
- Click on a ruleset to view its details and rules
- Use search to find specific rulesets

#### Editing Rulesets

- From the ruleset details page, click **Configure ruleset**
- Modify ruleset metadata or individual rules
- Save your changes

{/* #### Deleting Rulesets

- From the ruleset details page, click "Delete"
- Confirm the deletion */}

#### Using Templates

- When creating a new ruleset, select **Start from Template**
- Choose from pre-built templates for common standards
- Customize the template to meet your specific needs

### Testing Rulesets Against APIs

After creating your ruleset, you'll want to test it against your APIs to ensure it correctly identifies compliance issues. You can test a ruleset through the Governance UI:

1. Navigate to the Ruleset Details Page

    - Go to the **Rulesets** section and select the ruleset you want to test

2. Run an Evaluation

    - In the ruleset details page, locate the "**Test ruleset**" section
    - Select an API from the dropdown menu
    - Click the "**Run ruleset**" button

      <img src="/img/governance/ruleset-test-1.png" alt="" />

3. Review Results

     - The evaluation results will display any rule violations found in the API
     - Results are categorized by severity (High, Medium, Low)
     - Click "View issue info" on any violation to see detailed information, including:
       - The specific rule that was violated
       - The affected area in the API specification
       - Guidance on how to fix the issue

## Understanding Remediation Priority

In Tyk Governance, "Remediation Priority" indicates the urgency with which an API issue should be addressed, based on its risk level and potential impact. This priority helps teams focus their efforts on the most critical issues first.

### Severity Mapping

Remediation priority is directly derived from the severity level defined in the rule. When a rule violation is detected during evaluation, its severity level is mapped to a corresponding remediation priority:

| Severity Level | Remediation Priority | Visual Indicator |
| :---------------- | :---------------------- | :------------------ |
| error          | High                 | Red pill            |
| warn           | Medium               | Yellow/orange pill  |
| info           | Low                  | Green pill          |

## Use Cases

### Establishing Tiered Governance Standards

Create different rulesets for different API tiers based on criticality, allowing for appropriate governance without over-restricting less critical APIs.

**Implementation:**

1. Create a "Tier 1" ruleset with strict security, design, and documentation rules for mission-critical APIs
2. Create a "Tier 2" ruleset with moderate requirements for important but less critical APIs
3. Create a "Tier 3" ruleset with basic requirements for internal or non-critical APIs
4. Apply these rulesets selectively based on API classification

**Benefits:**

- Appropriate governance based on API importance
- More efficient use of development resources
- Clear expectations for different types of APIs

### Implementing Industry-Specific Standards

Create rulesets that enforce industry-specific regulations and best practices for APIs in regulated sectors.

**Implementation:**

1. Identify relevant industry standards (e.g., FAPI for financial services, HIPAA for healthcare)
2. Create rulesets that codify these standards as executable rules
3. Include detailed remediation guidance specific to the industry context
4. Apply these rulesets to APIs in the relevant domains

**Benefits:**

- Ensure compliance with industry regulations
- Reduce audit preparation time
- Standardize compliance approaches across teams

### Evolving Governance Standards Over Time

Use rulesets to gradually implement and evolve governance standards as your organization's API program matures.

**Implementation:**

1. Start with a basic ruleset focusing on critical security and fundamental design principles
2. Gradually add more rules as teams become familiar with the standards
3. Adjust severity levels over time (e.g., start as warnings, later promote to errors)
4. Incorporate feedback from development teams to refine rules

**Benefits:**

- Avoid overwhelming teams with too many rules at once
- Build governance maturity incrementally
- Gain buy-in through collaborative evolution

## Best Practices and Recommendations

- **Start with templates** for common standards like OWASP or OpenAPI best practices
- **Customize gradually** by adding organization-specific rules over time
- **Use appropriate severity levels** - reserve "error" for critical issues that must be fixed
- **Include clear remediation guidance** in the "howToFix" field for each rule
- **Group related rules** into focused rulesets (security, design, documentation)
- **Review and update rulesets regularly** as standards evolve
- **Collect feedback from developers** on rule clarity and usefulness
- **Document the purpose** of each ruleset for better organizational understanding
- **Maintain version control** for rulesets as they evolve
- **Assign ownership** to specific individuals or teams for each ruleset
