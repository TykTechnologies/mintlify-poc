It is possible to hot-restart a Tyk Gateway process without dropping any connections. This can be useful if you need to load up a new configuration or change a configuration on a production server without losing any traffic.

To hot-restart a Tyk Gateway process, you simply need to send a `SIGUSR2` signal to the process, for example:

```bash
> sudo kill -SIGUSR2 {gateway-pid}
```

This will fork and load a new process, passing all open handles to the new server and wait to drain the old ones.
