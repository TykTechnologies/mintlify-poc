With a SAAS Tyk Cloud Classic setup, multiple environment management is not possible because all traffic will run via our proxy and our infrastructure.

It is possible to use the Tyk Cloud Classic interface to manage multiple environments when you have Multi-Cloud gateways running in your environments and those can be targeted appropriately.
