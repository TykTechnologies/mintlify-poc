## Introduction

After deploying your Control Plane, you need to perform some initial configuration for the Developer Portal to prevent seeing any `Page Not Found` errors when trying to access the portal. You need to set up a Home page from the Control Plane Dashboard.

Watch our video on configuring your Tyk Cloud Developer Portal.
