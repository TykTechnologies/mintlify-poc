### Description

"Invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference" error

### Cause

There are a number of reasons, most commonly, an API may have been configured incorrectly in some way (for instance, it may have been set up without an organization). The error itself is a specific to Go language which Tyk was written in and could also suggest that alterations made to the code by the user could also be the culprit.

### Solution

Make sure that API definitions are set up correctly. Information on how to do this with the Tyk Gateway API can be found in the following links:
