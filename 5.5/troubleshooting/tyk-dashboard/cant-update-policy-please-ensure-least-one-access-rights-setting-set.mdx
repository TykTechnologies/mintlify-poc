### Description

Users receive this error when attempting to create a new Policy on the Dashboard.

### Cause

The Access Rights field is a required setting for a policy.

### Solution

Users should first [create a new API](/5.5/getting-started/create-api) and then [create a new policy](/5.5/getting-started/create-security-policy) with an existing API in the Access Rights.
