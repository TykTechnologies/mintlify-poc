Implementing best-practice API security requires a holistic approach that covers many different topics. It’s recommended to start by reading the [OWASP API Security Top 10](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0x00-header/), which is a great resource for API security practitioners that provides clear explanations of the various threats and solutions.

Two of the most prevalent topics are [authentication](/5.5/authentication) and [authorization](/5.5/authorisation), which occupy four of the top five positions. These are critical elements of API security, which verify the identity of API clients and control what they’re able to do. Alongside these are a number of other beneficial topics that are also within the remit of API management, all of which will be covered in this section. These include:

- [Governance](/5.5/governance)
- [Configuration](/5.5/configuration)
- [Resource Consumption](/5.5/resource-consumption)
