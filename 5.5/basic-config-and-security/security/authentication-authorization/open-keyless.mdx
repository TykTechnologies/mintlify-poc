Tyk keyless access represents completely open access for your API and causes Tyk to bypass any session-based middleware (middleware that requires access to token-related metadata). Most middleware will work with keyless access (header transformation, mocks, virtual endpoints, etc.).

## Use Case

Open access is very useful for situations where analytics is the key reason for tracking usage, using the Tyk node as a reverse logging proxy, since it adds extremely low latency to proxied requests. It can offer a great way to monitor how an API is being used by existing users without having to use a key store.

Keyless access will allow all requests through. All access control, versioning, quotas and rate limiting will not be possible as individual sessions are not identified.

## Example

To implement keyless access, simply set the flag in your API Definition:

```{.copyWrapper}
{
  ...
  "use_keyless": true,
  "auth": {
      "auth_header_name": ""
  },
  ...
}
```
This will stop checking keys that are proxied by Tyk.


<Note>
Keyless APIs cannot be selected for [Access Rights](/5.5/getting-started/create-security-policy) in a security policy.
