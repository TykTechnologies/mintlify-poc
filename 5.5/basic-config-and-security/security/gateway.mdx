The Tyk Gateway is the main component that will be internet-facing in your installation since it manages the traffic through to your services. The Gateway has a command and control API that must be secured, using a [shared secret](/5.5/planning-for-production#change-all-the-shared-secrets).

Although the Gateway has an API, it is recommended to integrate with the Dashboard API as this is more secure and more granular.
