To get started with the Enterprise Developer portal, you need to accomplish three steps:

1. [Connect to a provider (Tyk Self Managed)](/5.6/product-stack/tyk-enterprise-developer-portal/getting-started/with-tyk-self-managed-as-provider)
2. [Create and import API Products and Plans in your Tyk Self Managed Instance](/5.6/product-stack/tyk-enterprise-developer-portal/getting-started/create-api-product-and-plan)
3. [Create catalogs and developer audiences](/5.6/product-stack/tyk-enterprise-developer-portal/getting-started/create-orgs-and-catalogs)
4. [Publish API Products and Plans to the Developer portal so that API consumers can access them](/5.6/product-stack/tyk-enterprise-developer-portal/getting-started/customize-products-and-plans)

After the last step, you can start serving APIs to your developer audience.
