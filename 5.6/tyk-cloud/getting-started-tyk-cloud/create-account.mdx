## Introduction

You can use Tyk Cloud to manage your APIs effectively and with minimal effort. This page explains how to create an account, in order to start doing so.

## What happens when you create your Tyk Cloud account?

When you create your Tyk Cloud account, we do the following for you:

* Assign the account creator as a [Billing admin](/5.6/tyk-cloud/teams-&-users/user-roles) for the Organization. This user role allows you to manage the billing and plans for your org. You can also add other billing admins as required.
* Assign the new account to our [48 hours free trial plan](https://tyk.io/sign-up/#cloud)
