The [Tyk Dashboard API](/tyk-dashboard-api) is a superset of the Tyk Gateway API, enabling (almost) all of the core features and adding many more. The Dashboard API is also more granular and supports [Role Based Access Control](/tyk-dashboard/rbac) (RBAC) on both a multi-tenant, and user basis.

Using the Dashboard API it is possible to set Read / Write / ReadWrite / Deny access to sections of the API on a user by user basis, and also segregate User / Key / API Ownership by organization.

The availability of RBAC varies depending on the license or subscription. For further information, please check our [price comparison](https://tyk.io/price-comparison/) or consult our sales and expert engineers <ButtonLeft href="https://tyk.io/contact/" color="green" content="Contact us" />


<Note>
For optimal results, it is advisable to exclusively employ the Tyk Dashboard API (avoiding direct calls to the Tyk Gateway API) within a Self-Managed setup, enabling the Dashboard to manage the Tyk API gateways cluster.
