## Quick Setup

This section provides a step-by-step guide to quickly set up Tyk Self-Managed using Docker. 

### Prerequisites

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your system
2. Install the following CLI tools:
    - [Jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) (for JSON processing)
    - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (for cloning Github repository)
    - [curl](https://curl.se/download.html) (for making API requests)
3. Tyk Self-Managed license key (from your trial email) 
    - If you are having issues with your trial license, please contact info@tyk.io

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-self-managed-trial && cd tyk-self-managed-trial
    ```

2. Create a `.env` file at the root of your installation

   Create a file named `.env` in the **root directory** of your cloned repository and add your license key:

   ```
   DASH_LICENSE=<your-tyk-license-key>
   ```

   You can use the included `.env.example` file as a reference or starting point.

   > **Note:** Files starting with a dot (like `.env`) are hidden by default in Unix-based systems. Use the `ls -a` command to view them in your terminal.

3. Start the Tyk stack:

    ```
    docker compose up -d
    ```

    This command will download and start all the necessary containers:
    - Tyk Gateway
    - Tyk Dashboard
    - Developer Portal
    - Redis (Gateway dependency for caching)
    - PostgreSQL (Dashboard and Portal dependency for data storage)
    - Tyk Pump (for analytics)
    - Sample API service (httpbin)

    **Wait for the containers to initialize. This may take a few minutes depending on your system.**

5. Once all containers are running, you can verify their status with:

    ```
    docker compose ps
    ```

    <img src="/img/self-managed/self-managed-trial-docker-status.png" alt="Docker Container Status of Tyk Self Managed Trial" />

### Dashboard Tour

The Tyk Dashboard is your central hub for managing APIs, monitoring performance, and configuring security settings.

<img src="/img/self-managed/self-managed-trial-dashboard.png" alt="Self Managed Tyk Dashbaord" />

Let's explore the main sections available in the sidebar:

#### Navigating the Tyk Dashboard

Dashboard is organized into a few key categories:
* **API Management**: In API Management, you can access and edit all your APIs, create [data graphs](/api-management/data-graph), and add webhooks.
* **API Security**: In API Security, you can manage [keys](/api-management/policies#access-keys), [policies](/api-management/policies), and [certificates](/api-management/certificates) to customize your security settings. 
* **User Management**: In [User Management](/api-management/user-management), you can control permissions and access for users and user groups. You can also create profiles that help you manage third party identity providers for specific Tyk actions like signing into the portal or logging into the dashboard.
* **Monitoring**: In [Monitoring](/api-management/dashboard-configuration#traffic-analytics), you can view activity reports, logs, and analytics related to your APIs.
* **System Management**: In [System Management](/api-management/dashboard-configuration#extend-permissions-using-open-policy-agent-opa), you can affect OPA rules that define fine-grained access control for managing and enforcing permissions on various actions and resources in Tykâ€™s API management system.
{/* TODO: Remove this when we upgrade this guide to 5.9.0: In 5.9.0 the Classic Portal will be hidden in the Dashboard */}
* **Classic Portal**: In Classic Portal, you can affect permissions and configurations related to your developer portal. The Tyk Developer Portal is a platform that enables you to publish, manage, and promote your APIs to external developers.


For a comprehensive guide to the Dashboard, refer to the [using Tyk Dashboard](/getting-started/using-tyk-dashboard#dashboard-organization) guide.

#### Understanding the Pre-loaded APIs

Your trial environment comes with pre-configured sample APIs to help you explore Tyk's capabilities:

**1. httpbingo API Overview:**

- **Purpose**: A test API with various endpoints for exploring API management features
- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:8080/httpbingo`
- **Authentication**: API Key authentication (via Authorization header)
- **Rate Limiting**: Configured through policies (Sandbox and Production plans)

**Key Endpoints:**

- `/get`: Returns request data (headers, query parameters)
- `/headers`: Shows all request headers
- `/ip`: Returns the client's IP address
- `/xml`: Demonstrates response transformation (XML to JSON)
- `/status/{code}`: Returns specified HTTP status code
- `/mock`: Returns a mock response generated by Tyk

**2. F1 API Overview:**

- **Purpose**: Demonstrates JWT authentication with a real-world API providing Formula 1 racing data
- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:8080/f1-api` (proxies to https://f1api.dev/api/)
- **Authentication**: JWT HMAC authentication

   JWT Authentication Details:

   - **Shared Secret**: `topspecial256sharedbitlongsecret`
   - **JWT Generation**: You can use [jwt.io](https://jwt.io) to generate valid tokens
   - **Header Format**: `Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>`
- **Rate Limiting**: 4 requests per 15 seconds (configured through policy)

**Key Endpoints:**

- `/drivers`: Information about F1 drivers
- `/seasons`: Data about F1 racing seasons
- `/circuits`: Details about F1 racing circuits
- `/teams`: Information about F1 teams

To explore these APIs in detail:

1. In the Dashboard, go to the "APIs" section
2. Click on either "httpbingo API" or "F1 API"
3. Navigate through the tabs to see the various configuration options
4. Pay special attention to the `Endpoints` tab to see how individual endpoints are configured

### Developer Portal Preview

The [Developer Portal](/portal/overview/intro) provides a dedicated space for API consumers to discover, learn about, and subscribe to your APIs. It bridges the gap between API providers and consumers.

<img src="/img/self-managed/self-managed-trial-portal.png" alt="Developer Portal" />

As an administrator, you can customize the portal's appearance, content, and behavior to match your brand and requirements.

#### Exploring Available API Products and Catalogs

Login into the portal as an Admin user with credentials provided in the [previous section](/getting-started/quick-start#default-credentials-and-access-points) to explore the resources created in the portal. 

The Developer Portal organizes APIs into a structured hierarchy:

**Products, Plans, and Catalogs:**

- **[Products](/portal/api-products)**: API offerings that developers can consume. In your trial, there's a pre-configured product for the [httpbingo API](http://localhost:3001/admin/api_products).

- **[Plans](/portal/api-plans)**: Subscription tiers with different access levels and rate limits. [Your trial includes](http://localhost:3001/admin/plans):
  - **Sandbox Plan**: Limited rate (3 requests per 10 seconds) for testing and development
  - **Production Plan**: Higher capacity (100 requests per 60 seconds) for production use

- **[Catalogs](/tyk-stack/tyk-developer-portal/enterprise-developer-portal/managing-access/manage-catalogues)**: Collections of products and plans that can be made available to different audiences. Your trial has a public catalog containing the httpbingo API product and both plans.

#### Understanding the developer experience

To experience the portal from a developer's perspective:

1. You can access the [live portal](http://localhost:3001/) using the admin account. This is the public-facing interface for API consumers.
2. From here the API consumer can:
   1. Browse the [API catalog](http://localhost:3001/portal/catalogue-products) to see available products
   2. View the [API documentation](http://localhost:3001/portal/catalogue-products/httpbin-api-access-1), which is automatically generated from the API definition
   3. Create [apps](http://localhost:3001/portal/private/dashboard) and then Subscribe to a [plan](http://localhost:3001/portal/catalogue-products/httpbin-api-access-1) to get access credentials
   4. Test the API using the provided examples and your credentials

The Developer Portal streamlines the onboarding process for API consumers, making it easy for them to find, understand, and use your APIs.
