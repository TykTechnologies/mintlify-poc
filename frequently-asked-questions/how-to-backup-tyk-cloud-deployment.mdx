#### How can I track and audit changes made to Tyk Dashboard configurations"?

To track changes in Dashboard configurations, please submit a [support ticket](https://support.tyk.io/hc/en-gb/articles/8671452599708-Ticket-Submission-Guide). No configuration changes will occur without your explicit request.

#### If there's a configuration error or an unwanted change, can I easily revert to a previous API or Policy configuration? What are the options or best practices for effective rollbacks?

You can configure [Tyk-Sync](/product-stack/tyk-sync/overview) to synchronise APIs and Policies with any version control system, like GitHub or GitLab and use it to perform roll back. Keys are not synchronised with Tyk Sync.
