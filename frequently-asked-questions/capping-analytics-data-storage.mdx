What methods are available to enable me to manage my MongoDB analytics storage?

[Time Based Caps](/tyk-stack/tyk-manager/analytics/capping-analytics-data-storage.md#a-name-time-based-cap-a-time-based-cap)

[Size Based Caps](/tyk-stack/tyk-manager/analytics/capping-analytics-data-storage.md#a-name-size-based-cap-a-size-based-cap)


<Note>
Time based caps (TTL indexes) are incompatible with already configured size based caps.

<Note>
If you are using DocumentDB, capped collections are not supported. See [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/mongo-apis.html) for more details.
