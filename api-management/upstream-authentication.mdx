## Introduction

Tyk Gateway sits between your clients and your services, securely routing requests and responses. For each API proxy that you expose on Tyk, you can configure a range of different methods that clients must use to identify (authenticate) themselves to Tyk Gateway. These are described in detail in the [Client Authentication](/api-management/client-authentication) section.

In the same way as you use Client Authentication to securely confirm the identity of the API clients, your upstream services probably need to securely confirm the identity of their client - namely Tyk. This is where Tyk's flexible **Upstream Authentication** capability comes in.

When using Tyk, you can choose from a range of authentication methods for each upstream API:
- [Mutual TLS](/api-management/upstream-authentication/mtls)
- [Token-based authentication](/api-management/upstream-authentication/auth-token)
- [Request signing](/api-management/upstream-authentication/request-signing)
- [Basic Authentication](/api-management/upstream-authentication/basic-auth)
- [OAuth 2.0](/api-management/upstream-authentication/oauth)
    - [OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials](/api-management/upstream-authentication/oauth#oauth-client-credentials)
    - [OAuth 2.0 Password Grant](/api-management/upstream-authentication/oauth#oauth-resource-owner-password-credentials)



    <Note>
    Upstream Basic Authentication and Oauth 2.0 support are only available to licensed users, via the Tyk Dashboard. These features are not available to open source users.
    </Note>



<Warning>
Note that OAuth 2.0 Password Grant is prohibited in the [OAuth 2.0 Security Best Practice](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics-13#section-3.4") but is supported by Tyk for use with legacy upstream services.
</Warning>
