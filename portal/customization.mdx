## Portal Customization Overview

The Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal uses themes for customizing the live portal. We provide an out of the box theme that is using our own branding, itâ€™s called the `default` theme. You are welcome to use it and modify it for your needs, yet if you want to start with a blank page, you can also create a completely new theme.

This section provides a complete guide to full customization from the developer's point of view.
