# Redis RAM Calculator

Use this calculator to estimate the RAM requirements for your Redis instance when using Tyk. This tool helps you plan your infrastructure by calculating memory needs based on your expected API traffic, caching requirements, and analytics storage. The calculator considers factors like requests per second, cache hit rates, number of API keys, and analytics settings. Results show the total RAM per host accounting for your specified utilization threshold.
