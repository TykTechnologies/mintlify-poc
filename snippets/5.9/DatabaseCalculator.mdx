#### Database Storage Calculator

Use this calculator to estimate the storage requirements for your database when using Tyk. This tool helps you plan your database infrastructure by calculating storage needs based on your API traffic, analytics retention, and configuration data. The calculator considers factors like requests per second, analytics time-to-live, and the number of APIs and policies you manage. Results show the total storage requirement accounting for your specified utilization threshold.
